This is the data and analyses for the manuscript: Mena et al. "Vertical stratification shapes horizontal turnover in Neotropical butterfly communities".

Project aim

It is well-documented that the tropical forest biota is vertically stratified, and ecological theories from studies of the latitudinal gradient have been applied to predict and understand how communities vary across vertical strata. In butterflies, differences in abiotic conditions between the canopy and the understorey promote the evolution of distinct flight morphologies and physiologies. However, how these distinct morphologies relate to differences in dispersal ability are poorly explored and we lack a general understanding of how and why vertical stratification influences community turnover in tropical forests. Here, we explored how vertical stratification influences diversity, horizontal spatial similarity of assemblages and distance-decay patterns in understory and canopy butterflies across multiple ecosystems.
